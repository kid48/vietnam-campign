Consider this:
`+1 +32 –2`
This is not a story; this is a list of numbers. That’s obvious, and you don’t need me to tell you that.

Now consider this: 
*WIS +7 DEX +2 STR +1*
 Is this a story? No. Is it a character? Not really, though for someone versed in RPG lingo, it might be the beginning of a character type. (Perhaps an old wizard?)

Now consider this: 
*Dungeon … Orc … Wizard*
This is not a story; this is a list of words. For an RPGer the list might start to suggest some kind of story.

Now consider this, as we take those key words and begin to animate them: 
*Dungeon under a mage tower, guarded by an orc, who is holding a wizard prisoner*
That is not exactly a story either, but it is the beginning of one: it is the beginning of getting to a place where something is going to change or happen, and where there is a past we can reasonably imagine (How did the orc capture the wizard? Whose mage tower is it?) and a present and a potential future (Will the wizard escape? How? Does he even want to?).

Now consider this:
*Sir Torr the warrior, bloodied and exhausted, approaches the dungeon under a mage tower guarded by an orc who is holding a wizard prisoner.*
That is the beginning (or middle?) of a story. We are introducing a new character who immediately brings with him some kind of story (How did he get bloodied? Why is he approaching the mage tower? Does he know the wizard is here?) Let’s continue to develop this:
*Sir Torr the warrior, bloodied and exhausted,*
*approaches the dungeon under a mage tower*
*guarded by Valgrub the enslaved orc who is*
*holding Quenay the sorceress prisoner.*
And now consider this:
*Sir Torr the warrior, bloodied and exhausted,*
*approaches the dungeon under a mage tower*
*guarded by Valgrub the enslaved orc who is holding*
*Torr’s beloved Quenay the sorceress prisoner.*

Finally, we’ve got a story. Why? There’s a connection, a relationship. Sir Torr is coming to rescue his beloved Quenay. This thread of connection makes the story. Note that the things that transformed a list into a story are not stats, not dice rolls, and not game mechanics. They are personal and ultimately emotional—interpersonal, even: details of relationships, details of feelings. 

Stats are not story. Yes, you need stats to build out characters following RPG rule set conventions, but remember that they have no meaning on their own. When you start with numbers out of any other context for your character, you can find yourself at a dead end. Story is created from emotion, not stats.
